Avocado
=======

A Windows store app client for Avocado. This is an exploration into Windows Store App development, while simultaneously building a client for a service I love using - Avocado. 

I'm making use of a few different toolkits and helper projects for development. This app is built with C# and XAML in the MVVM pattern. The service providing data to the application is Avocado's API called Guacamole - https://avocado.io/guacamole/avocado-api

The goal is that you can clone the repo, open the solution, and hit F5 to run the app. Note that because this is a Windows Store app, Windows 8 / VS 2012 are required to build/launch.

If you have any questions, or are interested in contributing, let me know! 

I'm trying to keep up my progress by posting and closing issues in the tracker as I work on the app.
